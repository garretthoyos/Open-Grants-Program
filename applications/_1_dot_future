I want to be a part of it

Need technical guru to help
Continuum Brand IP 
The value I add is the value I'll get back in return
We apply for a 30k Grant. If all milestones are hit, we get 100k in extra funding (paid out in ETH or BTC ) The funding we would use to hire developers and pay ourselves to create an AR experience that will lead the user into the webXR app which can also be played in VR.
