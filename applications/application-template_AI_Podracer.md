## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

* CyberPunk meets Blockchain Education via Augmented & Virtual Reality. A Polkadot DAO.

Developers are a rare breed. We believe those pushing the foundation of fintech is just the tip of the iceberg. 

NFTs are just the beginning of a new wave of digital artists understanding this new technology. 

We seek to accelerate the adoption of Polkadot's ecosystem, Kusama, and connection to Ethereum to build the Metaverse.

Blockchain principles are best understood by most visual learners (non-developers) by experiencing them in a spacial environment.

The ability for VR & AR to be used as an experiential teaching tool makes things that were not previously possible - not only possible - but 5-10x more efficient in the creation process by taking what might take a team of individuals working full time, down to just 1 artist/educator surrounded by immediate feedback from others. No development required for Phase 1. Phase 2 we will use our inhouse developers. Phase 3 will be for launching the unstoppable sustainable game on another existing platform.

This is The Blockchain Gamified. 

Similar to learning Solidity via Crypto Zombies, but in a spatial gaming environment.

* 1. Users learn about Polkadot and it's importance to the ecosystem for web3, the spatial web, and the convergence of exponential technology.

* 2. Users design their coinracer. The design of the vehicle is the sleek sexy part the users get to design. This is where the user gets introduced to non-fungible art and create an NFT. The engine is a visual representation of how blockchain is powered and instead of with words, we use physically stacking existing pieces together, much like blockchain innovation works today. 

* 3. Users compete in a race of blockchain protocols. The environment is generated by AI so every time the user enters a race, the race is a never before seen course, creating a unique playing experience every time.

Users enter a Virtual Reality battle for cryptocurrency and NFTs. As soon as the race is complete, the winning user wins the digital pinkslip to the other users' Coinracer NFT. The Coinracer can be used to strip parts from and build a better version of their CoinRacer. When no other users are available, the user can compete against AI at their current skill level. Skill level custimization for sharpness of turns and obstacles. Coins around the course can be collected and added to the users wallet. 

As competition gets tougher, users are awarded cryptocurrency in addition to winning the losers CoinRacer. 

Monthly competitions similar to what already exists from games like Echo VR and Blaston on Oculus Quest however it's similar to TribeXR (learning to be a DJ) where you get hands on experience and a virtual guide to help train you on your journey through blockchain.

Users learn, build, and get rewarded through play.

The podracers created in Quill VR and imported into Unreal Engine 5 where the procedural world and game mechanics will be created. 

* Polkadot ecosytem has already created a framework to stack upon. Examples include in progress projects like Bit Country, GamePower, Xaya, Enfipy, Saito, Subgame Network, and New Omega. We wish to expand and stack on this growing ecosystem to bring more users to Polkadot. 

We plan to do this by creating in game sponsors by blockchain companies just like F1 racing by putting Blockchain Protocol brand logos on the CoinRacers to promote blockchain interopability with Polkadot's parachain ability. Example Reference of how branding/advertising can be used: https://ibb.co/Pjb95hq

We are pioneering blockchain education through spatial gaming. 

*  We believe VR in the Metaverse with the growing ecosyystem of interconnected blockchains and artificial intelligence in games is revolutionizing the way we work and play. 

Our team is dedicated to innovating within XR and Blockchain. We have a depth of experience in the animation, gaming industries. We have worked on projects from The Void to futuristic race gaming to Star Wars to feature animation like Rio & Ice Age. We have indepth sales and marketing experience as well as the creation of real world objects into NFTs. 

We are excited to use our development and artistic expertise within 3D graphics to merge with Polkadot's technology and allow interopability between centralized, decentralized, and a distributed future of gaming. 

Unreal Engine 5 (Beta) allows for highly realistic wireless gaming. 

We see Virtual Reality as the inevitable future of work. Happiness and fun at work preceeds success in life. This is an opportunity to combine gaming, education, and ride the wave of current technology.

https://youtu.be/AQVGxz6iaH0

* Specifications of the core functionality
Phase 1:

Quill Theatre: App on Oculus Quest
Using Quill to teach and build worlds for extremely fast prototyping. The videos in Quill are extremely stylized & can be published as 3D storybook worlds. 
See example here:
https://youtu.be/27dgOzzTQOU

Phase 2:
These stylized characters and worlds will be exported from Quill and imported to Unreal Engine 5 for an interactive experience.

* What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement

We will not be creating an entire ecosystem like Decentraland, we will depend on existing decentralized platforms to plug into to achieve our goals. 


* This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

Quill is both the creation tool and publishing tool for the educational experiences. These worlds alone are not interactive but animated to be as if you're immersed in this other pre-animated world. You get to witness it on a loop with spatial audio and visuals. We will have a person speaking into the users ear, guiding them exactly what is going on.

We see it a significant challenge with current tron style racing game on Oculus Quest where users experience mootion sickness due to fast speed and poor game mechanics. Our focus for Phase 1 is on the actual education of Polkadot's ecosystem. Phase 2 will be creating the interactive design of the racer and seeing how other users create their racer. Phase 3 will be the racing/gaming portion. 

### Ecosystem Fit

* Our Target Audience is Gamers on Oculus Quest who typically are also fans of Star Wars and who would be interested in learning about crypto but have previously found it to be too technical.


* What need(s) does your project meet?

Roll The Blockchain from Early Adopter to Mass Adoption. Polkadot's technical ecosystem to non-developers through something a 5 year old can understand. 

* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?

* If so, how is your project different?

* If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

### Overview

Phase 1: 13 weeks
Milestone 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Education - Taking pieces that have already been built and designed by protocols/brands 

1. We have created 3D Assets based off Polkadot's main website 2D designs. We will use these assets to teach principles to visual learners. 


This is acceptable form of education experienced via Youtube, however we suggest it is best to create augmented and virtual reality learning tools. Not only is this terrific for marketing purposes, users tend to share more, and spatial experiences are stored in our memory as real experiences. 

Spatial Education Lessons: 


* **Total Estimated Duration:** 
Phase 1: 13 weeks - 100% created using Quill VR
Phase 2: 36 weeks - Taking content we've already created and making an Unreal Engine 5 realtime interactive webXR game. 
Phase 3: Infinity - The game is fully unstoppable, an ecosystem DAO given to the users to create.

* **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  1.32 FTE

* **Total Costs:** 
We are seeking an initial $30,000 in funding.
Phase 1: $29,900 
Phase 2: $100,000 
Phase 3: Cashflow. We seek to bring more than $130,000 in value back to the ecosystem via NFT gaming, in game NFT advertisements, and utilizing other Polkadot projects to exceed expectations.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

The team member heading this project met an intern from Web3 Foundation and became very interested in Polkadot's ecosystem initially as an investment, but when there wasn't an easy way to purchase DOT he went down the rabbit hole and found Substrate and Kusama and how it was the inevitable future of the blockchain's interopability to build a distributed metaverse. He joined the network and is now an Ambassador.
